Tanzania Police Force — Physiotherapy Department (Template Adaptation)

This README explains the changes made and lists image assets you should add or replace for Phase 1 (Planning & Branding: Logo & Imagery).

What I updated in `index.html`:
- Page title set to "Tanzania Police Force - Physiotherapy Department".
- Topbar contact updated to: +255 22 123 4567 | physiotherapy@police.go.tz | Police Headquarters, Dar es Salaam.
- Navbar brand replaced with an emblem image placeholder and department text.
- Navigation labels updated: `About Us`, `Our Regions & Units`, `Our Specialties`, `Our Team`, `News & Updates`, `Contact`.
- Hero section updated with new headings and CTA buttons linking to `#regions` and `#specialties`.
- About section rewritten with mission, mandate and scope. Added `id="about"`.
- Services section repurposed to `Our Regions & Units` (added `id="regions"` and six region boxes).
- Team and Blog headings updated to `Our Team` and `News & Updates` respectively.
- Footer contacts updated and disclaimer/copyright updated.

Image placeholders added (you should provide actual images):
- `img/tpf-emblem.png` — Official Tanzania Police Force emblem (prefer transparent PNG, ~48–120px height)
- `img/hero-physio.jpg` — Hero image: professional physiotherapist in police clinic / dignified team photo / symbolic rehabilitation image
- `img/about-physio.jpg` — Image used in About section: clinic or physiotherapy equipment in a police setting

Suggested additional replacements across the site (not yet edited):
- `img/team-1.jpg`, `img/team-2.jpg`, `img/team-3.jpg` — Replace with photos of the Chief Physiotherapist and regional leads (use uniformed, professional images with consent).
- `img/blog-*.jpg`, `img/testimonial-*.jpg`, `img/price-*.jpg` — Replace with images relevant to physio services, equipment, or regional clinics.

Image sourcing & legal/ethical guidance:
- Use only official department photos or images with explicit consent from subjects. For staff photos, obtain signed consent or a written release.
- For stock images, prefer licensed images (e.g., paid stock, or free images under permissive licenses) and record attribution if required.
- Avoid using other organizations' logos or emblems without permission. The official Tanzania Police Force emblem should only be used with proper authorization.

Next recommended steps (I can implement these if you want):
- I can add the new image files (placeholders) so the site renders locally.
- Update other pages (`about.html`, `service.html`, `team.html`, `blog.html`, `contact.html`) to match the new content structure and labels.
- Create an "Our Specialties" section (`id="specialties"`) either on the homepage or its own page describing Sports Injury, Post-Op Rehab, Ergonomics, etc.

If you want, I can now:
- Add placeholder images (temporary) into `img/` so pages render without broken images.
- Apply similar textual updates to other pages listed above.

Tell me which of those next steps you want me to do now.
